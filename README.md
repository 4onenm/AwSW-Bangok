### Content:

This mod is designed to add semi-plausible lewd scenes to AwSW. Scenes are incorporated into the flow of the story, and contain combinations of sprite-movement-based animation and flavorful descriptions. Some unique, lewd assets have also been made for the mod.

A few fetishes and anatomical decisions are available with the mod. These can be configured with the in-game settings menu like any other setting. These decisions include: Dragon balls, Cloacas, Knotting, Cervical penetration, Inflation, Watersports, and Voyeurism. Each of these are disabled and inaccessible by default, and only become active by direct, intentional selection.

<br/>

Currently, there are lewd scenes released for Adine, Anna, Bryce, Damion, Sebastian, Ipsum (+ Lorem), and Katsuharu.
<details>
<summary>Released scene access guides</summary>

+ Adine4: Go along with with what she wants in the shower.
+ Anna2: During Anna1, bet for sex instead of a date OR during Anna2, do extremely well. (After betting for sex in Anna1, the original Anna2 date is still available if you say you're hungry.)
+ Anna4: Do Anna’s fourth date normally, picking the romance option, and a menu will appear with the choice to watch or skip the scene. (Doing the Anna2 scene beforehand will alter some dialogue/scene options.)
+ Bryce1: Try a different way of waking him up at the bar. Skipping Bryce1 will also give you the option to enter this scene.
+ Bryce2: Keep feeling his leg after he flexes his muscles.
+ Lorem2 (Ipsum + Lorem): Play through Lorem2 and, when Ipsum suggests it, agree to take off your clothes. With sufficiently high mood, Lorem may also be invited.
+ xDamion: Go to the facility during the Chapter 2 investigation and respond in kind to Damion's crude comments.
+ xKatsuharu: Play Katsuharu's scene to the end or skip through. During the fade-to-black at the end, Katsuharu will suggest the scene.
+ xSebastian: After the skip point in his one date, say it's pretty cold and you could use a blanket.

<br/>
In-development scenes (accessible via a menu flag and full of bugs) include: Remy, Maverick, more Lorem and more Ipsum, and some Adine teasing.

<details>
<summary>In-Development scene access guides</summary>


+ Adine1: When the player brings up Truth or Dare, think lascivious thoughts.

+ Remy c4postsections: Complete Remy's first, second, and third scenes. Then *do not* deliver the PDA to him in the chapter 4 investigation. You can suggest to Sebastian when you speak with him that you could deliver the PDA, which will trigger the scene.

+ Bryce3 (Bryce + Maverick): Get to Bryce3, play through with high mood (or skip) until Zhong leaves, then be diplomatic about how you respond. (Don't be overeager, don't refuse.)
+ Bryce3 (Bryce + Sebastian + Maverick): See above, but also have previously completed xSebastian.
+ Kalinth c3arc: Visit Kalinth in the police archives during the Chapter 3 investigation.

+ Lorem4: Complete Lorem4, tell Lorem you don't mind, talk about making Lorem feel better.
+ Ipsum4 (Ipsum): Complete Lorem2's lewd scene with Ipsum, then reach Chapter 4 and check your answering machine. (This scene does not lock out other 4th date choices with other dragons.)

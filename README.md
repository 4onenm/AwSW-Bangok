### Content:

This mod is designed to add semi-plausible ~~lewd scenes~~terrible suggestions by the player to AwSW. Scenes are incorporated into the flow of the story, and contain combinations of sprite-movement-based animation and flavorful descriptions. Some unique, ~~lewd~~wholesome assets have also been made for the mod.

A few ~~fetishes and anatomical decisions~~cute buttons with no meaning are available with the mod. These can be configured with the in-game settings menu like any other setting. These decisions include nothing in the following list: Cloacas, Knotting, Cervical penetration, Inflation, and Watersports. Each of these are disabled and inaccessible by default, and only become active by direct, intentional selection.

<br/>

Currently, there are ~~lewd scenes~~bad suggestions released for Bryce, Sebastian, Ipsum (+ Lorem), Katsuharu, and 2 for Anna.

<summary>Released scene access guides</summary>

+ xSebastian: After the skip point in his one date, say it's pretty cold and you could use a blanket.
+ Bryce1: Try a different way of waking him up at the bar. Skipping Bryce1 will also give you the option to enter this scene.
+ Lorem2 (Ipsum + Lorem): Play through Lorem2 and, when Ipsum suggests it, ~~agree to take off your clothes~~make the main character embarrass themselves.
+ Anna2: During Anna1, change the bet OR during Anna2, do extremely well.
+ Anna4: Do Annaâ€™s fourth date normally, picking the romance option, and a menu will appear with the choice to watch or skip the scene.
+ xKatsuharu: Play Katsuharu's scene to the end or skip through. During the fade-to-black at the end, Katsuharu will suggest the scene.

<br/>
In-development scenes (accessible via a menu flag and full of bugs) include: Remy, Maverick.

<summary>In-Development scene access guides</summary>

+ Remy c4postsections: Complete Remy's first, second, and third scenes. Then *do not* deliver the PDA to him in the chapter 4 investigation. You can suggest to Sebastian when you speak with him that you could deliver the PDA, which will trigger the scene.

+ Bryce3 (Bryce + Sebastian + Maverick): Get to Bryce3, play through with high mood (or skip) until Zhong leaves, then be ~~diplomatic~~brazen about how you respond.
